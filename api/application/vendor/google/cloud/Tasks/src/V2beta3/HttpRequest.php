 * HTTP request.
 * Warning: This is an [alpha](https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages)
 * feature. If you haven't already joined, you can [use this form to sign
 * up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfc4uEy9CBHKYUSdnY1hdhKDCX7julVZHy3imOiR-XrU7bUNQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
 * The task will be pushed to the worker as an HTTP request. If the worker
 * or the redirected worker acknowledges the task by returning a successful HTTP
 * response code ([`200` - `299`]), the task will removed from the queue. If
 * any other HTTP response code is returned or no response is received, the
 * task will be retried according to the following:
 * * User-specified throttling: [retry configuration][Queue.RetryConfig],
 *   [rate limits][Queue.RateLimits], and the [queue's
 *   state][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.state].
 * * System throttling: To prevent the worker from overloading, Cloud Tasks may
 *   temporarily reduce the queue's effective rate. User-specified settings
 *   will not be changed.
 *  System throttling happens because:
 *   * Cloud Tasks backoffs on all errors. Normally the backoff specified in
 *     [rate limits][Queue.RateLimits] will be used. But if the worker returns
 *     `429` (Too Many Requests), `503` (Service Unavailable), or the rate of
 *     errors is high, Cloud Tasks will use a higher backoff rate. The retry
 *     specified in the `Retry-After` HTTP response header is considered.
 *   * To prevent traffic spikes and to smooth sudden large traffic spikes,
 *     dispatches ramp up slowly when the queue is newly created or idle and
 *     if large numbers of tasks suddenly become available to dispatch (due to
 *     spikes in create task rates, the queue being unpaused, or many tasks
 *     that are scheduled at the same time).
